___

This is a Unity VR project where you are in a square village.<br>
You can interact with your hands (open and close them). <br>
You can find two buttons in the village, pressing them triggers fireworks. <br>
The sky is a Custom made Skybox, created from one of my Minecraft Texture packs. <br>
The hand was custom made (not the best looking one, but still a kinda robotic hand)
